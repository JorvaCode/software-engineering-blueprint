# 05 — Implementation

Implement the approved design in small, reviewable increments.

## Rules
- Follow project coding standards.
- Preserve architectural boundaries.
- Simple solutions should be preferred.
- Apply `standards/code-design.md`: SOLID and Clean Code as diagnostics, patterns only
  when justified in the design.
- Avoid unrelated changes.
- Add tests with the implementation.
- Keep documentation synchronized.

## Information items
### Inputs
- **Design** — the outputs of `04-design.md`.
- **Project coding standards** — the conventions the project has adopted, whether or not they are written down. An unwritten standard is a decision waiting to be recorded.
- **Repository state** — the branch, the existing tests, and the current build status.

### Outputs
- **Implementation** — the change, in increments that build and test independently.
- **Tests** — added in the same change as the code they cover, never deferred.
- **Conformance record** — the result of the project's lint, format and static analysis. Where the project runs none, the record states that, so the absence is a decision rather than an oversight.
- **Documentation updates** — the documents this change makes wrong, updated in the same change.

## Quality gate
The change builds, the tests pass, and the conformance record for the changed paths holds no finding the change introduced. Design quality is recorded against `standards/code-design.md`, or the change states that the check produced no finding. A reviewer who did not pair on the change reaches the same verdict from the build output and the conformance record alone.
